I am currently pursuing both a Bachelors and a Masters Degree in Computer Science at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/), and I will graduate in June 2025 and 2026.

I am interested in Machine Learning for Robotics and Generative Artificial Intelligence, and I incredibly excited to share my first paper: [ManiSkill3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00425)
